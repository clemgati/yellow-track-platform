# Yellow Track Platform

A cross-platform software ecosystem for photographers, built with Kotlin Multiplatform and Compose Multiplatform.

> Status: Active development  
> Current release: `0.1.0 Genesis`  
> Current milestone: `0.2.0 Blueprint`

## Vision

Yellow Track Platform exists to help photographers spend less time managing their workflow and more time creating exceptional images.

The platform will support a family of products built on shared domain logic, data, design, and integrations:

- **Studio OS** — desktop workflow and studio management
- **Studio Mobile** — preflight, gear, lighting, and session tools
- **Studio Client** — proofing, selections, releases, and delivery
- **Studio Intelligence** — analytics, recommendations, and future AI-assisted tools

## Supported platforms

The initial foundation targets:

- Android
- iOS
- macOS/Desktop

## Technology

- Kotlin Multiplatform
- Compose Multiplatform
- Gradle Kotlin DSL

Additional platform technologies will be introduced through documented architecture decisions.

## Repository status

The project is currently in the **Genesis** milestone. The focus is project identity, architecture, engineering standards, and a stable cross-platform foundation.

Business features have not yet been implemented.

## Project structure

The project will remain intentionally simple while the architecture develops. New Gradle modules will be introduced only when they provide a clear ownership or dependency benefit.
